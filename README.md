# TO-DO App

Recruitment task for MDBootstrap.

In React, create a simple task list application (TO-DO App). The application after launch shows 3 buttons - Add, Remove and Clear.

1. After clicking the Add button, a new task appears on the list under the buttons with the content "Task number #" where # is the number of the task.
2. After clicking the Add button again, another task with the next number is added to the list.
3. Pressing the Remove button deletes the last task (task with the highest number).
4. Pressing the Clear button removes all tasks from the list.
